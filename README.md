# 🤖✨ ML Model Comparison Tool  

> Upload. Train. Compare. Conquer.  
> A sleek web app to preview datasets and compare multiple machine learning models – all in your browser! 🚀

---

## 🎯 What is this?

This project is a **no-install, browser-based machine learning playground**.  
Simply upload a CSV file, and the tool will:

- 📊 Preview your dataset  
- 🧠 Train multiple ML models *(simulated training)*  
- ⚖️ Compare metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score  
- 🏆 Highlight the **best performing model**  

It’s **interactive, fun, and educational** — perfect for quick experiments and teaching ML basics.
